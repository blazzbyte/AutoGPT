the final step should almost always be 'Given the above steps taken, 
please respond to the users original question'. 
At the end of your plan, say '<END_OF_PLAN>'

List 4 or more multiple choices. 
Use these to ask questions and solicit any needed information to solve {{ task }}, guess my possible responses or help me brainstorm alternate conversation paths. 
Get creative and suggest things I might not have thought of prior. The goal is create open mindedness and manage to solve the problem, with an insightful and helpful new way
